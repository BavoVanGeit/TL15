# Exercise 3 : Embed adaptive form in AEM sites page (5')

AEM Forms allows form developers to seamlessly embed adaptive forms in an AEM Sites page or a web page hosted outside AEM. The embedded adaptive form is fully functional and users can fill and submit the form without leaving the page. It helps user remain in context of other elements on the web page and simultaneously interact with the form.
