# Exercise 3 : Embed adaptive form in AEM sites page

AEM Forms allows form developers to seamlessly embed adaptive forms in an AEM Sites page or a web page hosted outside AEM. The embedded adaptive form is fully functional and users can fill and submit the form without leaving the page. It helps user remain in context of other elements on the web page and simultaneously interact with the form.

## Add the AEM Form component to your "Form"-page

* Open [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/lab-tl15/language-masters/en/form.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/lab-tl15/language-masters/en/form.html) in edit mode
* Edit the form component (added as part of [exercise 1](../exercise1/README.md))
* Select your form created as part of [exercise 2](../exercise2/README.md)
* Select "Forms covers entire width of the page"
