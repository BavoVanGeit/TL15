# AEM Forms portal default draft/submit behavior]

By default, a form uses the "Forms Portal Submit Action" to handle the saved or submitted data, we will later on in the lab how you can submit using 

AEM Forms portal drafts and submissions component allows users to save their forms as drafts and submit later from any device. Also, users can view their submitted forms on portal. To enable this functionality, AEM Forms provides data and metadata services to store the data filled in by a user in the form and the form metadata associated with drafts and submitted forms. This data is stored in the CRX repository, by default. However, as users interact with forms through AEM publish instance, which is generally outside the enterprise firewall, organizations may want to customize data storage for it to be more secure and reliable.

In this excercise we will expplore the default behavior, in Exercise 4 we will implement a custom "Forms Portal Submit Action"
