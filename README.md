# TL15 AEM Forms for developers: To submit or not to submit?

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) provides an easy-to-use solution to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating with back-end processes, business rules, and data.
 
In this session we will focus on the data-related aspects of AEM Forms. You will learn about saving/auto-saving forms and trigger an email with a link to the saved form using Adobe Campaign. We will discuss form prefilling and the submission of forms towards an external system. This session requires some familiarity with component development in Adobe Experience Manager.
 
In this track youâ€™ll get hands on experience doing:

* Data  integration
* Custom submit actions
* Setup prefilling

Outline on the lab

## [1. Your Environment](exercise1/README.md)

Before we start, we will deploy our website and add a couple pages required for this lab.

## [2. Create a Form and use a JSON Schema as the form model](exercise2/README.md)

In this exercise you will create a form that we will use throughout the lab.

## [3. Integrate your form into the site](exercise3/README.md)

Make the form experience an integral part of your site.

## [3. Create Your Adaptive form](exercise2/README.md)

## [4. Add Your form to a page](exercise3/README.md)

## [5. The Default draft/submit](exercise4/README.md)

Adaptive forms require Submit actions to process user-specified data. A Submit action determines the task performed on the data that you submit using an adaptive form. Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) includes OOTB Submit actions that demonstrate custom tasks you can perform using the user-submitted data. For example, you can perform tasks, such as sending email or storing the data.

## [6. The Custom draft/submit ](exercise5/README.md)

A submit action is triggered when a user clicks the Submit button on an adaptive form. You can configure the submit action on adaptive form. Adaptive forms provide a few out of the box submit actions. You can copy and extend the default submit actions to create you own submit action. However, based on your requirements, you can write and register your own submit action to process data in the submitted form.

AEM Forms allows users to save an adaptive form as a draft. The draft functionality provides users with the option to maintain a work-in-progress form. A user can then complete and submit the form at any time from any device.

By default, AEM Forms stores the user data associated with the draft and submission on the Publish instance in the /content/forms/fp node.

However, AEM Forms portal components provides data services that allow you to customize the implementation of storing user data for drafts and submissions. For example, you can store the data in a data store currently implemented in your organization.

To customize the storage of user data, you need to implement the Draft Data and Submission Data services.

==========

With AEM Forms, you can store:

Drafts: A work-in-progress form that end users fill and save for later, and submit afterwards.
Submissions: Submitted forms containing user provided data.
AEM Forms Portal data and metadata services provide support for drafts and submissions. By default the data is stored in the publish instance, which is then reverse-replicated to configured author instance to be available for percolation to other publish instances.

The concern with the existing out-of-the-box approach is, that it stores all the data on publish instance, including the data which can be Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

In addition to above mentioned default approach, an alternative implementation is also available for directly pushing the form data to processing instead of saving it locally. Customers having concerns about storage of potentially sensitive data on publish instance can choose the alternative implementation in which the data is sent to a processing server. Since processing happens on the author instance, it typically stays in a secure zone.
