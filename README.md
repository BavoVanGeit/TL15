# TL15 AEM Forms for developers: To submit or not to submit?

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) provides an easy-to-use solution to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating with back-end processes, business rules, and data.
 
In this session we will focus on the data-related aspects of AEM Forms. You will learn about saving/auto-saving forms and trigger an email with a link to the saved form using Adobe Campaign. We will discuss form prefilling and the submission of forms towards an external system. This session requires some familiarity with component development in Adobe Experience Manager.
 
In this track youâ€™ll get hands on experience doing:

* Data  integration
* Custom submit actions
* Setup prefilling

A submit action is triggered when a user clicks the Submit button on an adaptive form. You can configure the submit action on adaptive form. Adaptive forms provide a few out of the box submit actions. You can copy and extend the default submit actions to create you own submit action. However, based on your requirements, you can write and register your own submit action to process data in the submitted form.
