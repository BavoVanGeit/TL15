# Autosave Forms

You can configure an adaptive form to automatically start saving the content based on an event or a pre-defined time-interval. By default, contents of an adaptive form are saved on a user action, such as on pressing the save button. The auto save option is helpful in:

* Automatically saving the content for anonymous and logged-in users
* Saving the content of a form without or minimal user intervention
* Start saving content of a form based on a user event
* Saving the content of a form repeatedly after a specified time interval
